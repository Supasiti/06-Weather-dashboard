In this project, I was tasked to write a weather dashboard as a way to practice making server side API requests. The weather data for cities is accessible through [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api).

The final products should have the following features:
- When the page is load initially, the user is presented with form inputs. 
- When the user correctly enters a city name, the current weather and a 5-day forecast for that city should appear
- They should have 
  - the city name, 
  - the date, 
  - an icon representation of weather condition,
  - the wind speed,
  - the temperature, and
  - the UV index, which is colour coded to indicate the severity.
- A search is saved each time and weather data can retrieved when they click on it.

The end product should resemble the mock-up provided below:
